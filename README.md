* I kept on getting errors in my code when i was trying to map through the API and i was getting items.map() is not a function.

* When i finally figured it out i wasnt able to get data back from my API, i tried using data from a different source and i got all the data back, i will revisit my code and 
  fix this issue and make it work as i hoped for. 

* This is the API i used to get data back successfully "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users". * NB : This data is temporary on my app for now.*
